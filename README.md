# leaflet-challenge
In this challenge my task was to visualize an earthquake dataset. 
With the help of the Tutors:
Import and visualize the data by doing the following:

Used Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth  appear darker in color.


Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
 I worked with a Tutor on the assignment, he assisted me with the HTML coding.
